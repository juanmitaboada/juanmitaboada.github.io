# Professional profile

# What do I do?

- Mainly, I write software in C and Python to support massive data processing in real-time at [Veturis](http://www.veturis.es)

- In my spare time, I am developing my own ROV Drone Submarine developed only with microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32 & Raspberry Pi Pico). I developed it from scratch.

We mainly developed [CODENERIX](https://www.codenerix.com) and built tools for Enterprise Resource Planning for middle-size companies. In the meantime, we also became official providers for Google Workspace with a top 150 unique clients.

- Nowadays, I also collaborate with Andalusea Submarine Robotics in any event that happens during weekends, and I have been a pilot for Submarine ROVs in Open Water.
